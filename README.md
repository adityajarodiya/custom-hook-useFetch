A simple and reusable React custom hook (useFetch) designed to simplify data fetching from APIs, along with an example application demonstrating its usage. This project showcases how to build a custom hook that manages loading, data, and error states effectively.



Features
useFetch Hook: A custom hook that abstracts away the complexities of fetch API calls.

Loading State: Provides a loading boolean to indicate when data is being fetched.

Error Handling: Captures and exposes any errors that occur during the fetch process.

Data Return: Returns the fetched data once available.

Example Component: A React component (App.jsx) that consumes the useFetch hook to display product data from a dummy API.

Styling: Basic CSS styling for a clean and responsive user interface.
